# Protal-Auth-Test
## My submission for Fully designed Login and Sign up page for PROTAL APP using React Native framework.

- The app uses React-Native framework, i.e. using Javascript and React to make Native Apps.
- It uses axios api to use backend server hosted in node.js and database in MongoDB.
- It features Login, Sign in with Google, Sign up, and Log out functionalities.
- Data Authentication is done using manual coding.
- Styled components are used extensively for a better layout.
